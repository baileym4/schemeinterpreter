# Scheme Interpreter

**Overview:**

This project, titled Scheme Interpreter, is a Python codebase designed to operate as a Scheme interpreter, enabling users to interact with and execute Scheme programming language code. The interpreter parses Scheme expressions, manages variable bindings, and executes functions, supporting various Scheme features such as lexical scoping and lambda expressions.

**Functionality:**

The primary code is stored in the `lab.py` file, housing functions for parsing, operations, variable binding, and more. Users can run the `lab.py` file to engage with their terminal using Scheme, with the `schemerepl.py` file ensuring smooth interaction.

**Testing:**

The `test.py` file, created by MIT 6.101 course staff, includes test cases to validate the functionality of the interpreter. The `test_files`, `test_inputs`, and `test_outputs` folders contain relevant files for users to verify the correct execution of the code through these test cases.

**Getting Started:**

To use the Lisp Interpreter, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/baileym4/schemeinterpreter.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd scheme-interpreter`
3. Run the `lab.py` file to start the Scheme interpreter in your terminal.
